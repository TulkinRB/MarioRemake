& shoot fireballs.

When you jump on Koopa (the turtle), it gets into it's shell,
you can throw the shell on other mosters in order to kill it.
If you jump under a "?" block, you will get a coin, or
"Super mushroom", or "1up mushroom"
If you eat "super mushroom", you will become "Super Mario"
When you are "Super Mario", if you touch a monster, you
will return to be "Mario".
If you are "Super Mario" you will get a "fire flower", instead
of "Super mushroom". If you eat it, you will become "Fire Mario".
When you are "Fire Mario", you can shoot fireballs on monsters.

If you collect a starman, you will get invinsible for a while,
during that time if you touch a moster it will die.
